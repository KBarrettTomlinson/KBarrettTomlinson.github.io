          This is the paragraph where I will talk about myself. Right now, I'm listening to Doug Loves Movies. It is upsettingly tense.
          There is a comedian that was on the previous episode and he was exhausting, and now on this episode he is just as bad. 
          I am only really listening to it out of obligation. I think Sean is on the phone with David. David is our friend which is
          in the Army. He lived here for several years, but now he and his wife, Stephanie, live in Texas.

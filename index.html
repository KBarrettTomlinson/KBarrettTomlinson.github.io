          This is a paragraph about myself. Changes. 
          It will be a combination of information about me as an employee, 
          why I am a good candidate from Prime Academy, 
          and why I want to go to Prime Academy. I was walking far from home, where the names were not burned along the wall.
          Sour building, high as heave, but the door was so small, dor was so small. I saw rainclouds, little babies, and a bridge that had tumbled to the ground.
          I saw sinners making music and I dreamt of that sound, dreamt of that sound.
